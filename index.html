                    <p>Prior to this week I had never attempted to create a website before. My aims for Week1 were to create a simple 3 page website. This page will act as my learning journal where I will record what I have done each week.
                    In week 1 I have created 3 functional HTML texts. I have also managed to access my Web drive and learnt how to access my website. I have been introduced to some basic concepts such as the anatomy of an HTML, the use of tags within HTML elements, basic ways to nest an element and the difference between block and inline elements. I have also been introduced to the concept of HTML syntax and HTML semantics.
                </p>
    
            
                <h4>What I achieved in my lab session:</h4>
            
            <ul>
              
               <li>Created 3 working HTML texts</li>
               <li>Accessed my Web drive to output my HTML texts </li>
               <li>Input a relative link in my website i.e. internal website link</li>
               <li>Input an absolute link i.e. an external website link</li>
               <li>Edited my HTML pages</li>
               <li>Validated my Html page using <a href =" http://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3c mark-up validation services</a></li>
               
            </ul>

                <p>In the first week I had added some content to my HTML page, used some basic tags and tested my HTML page using the W3c validator. My aims for week 2 were to use some different tags to create new content in the correct syntax. The content I will be looking to add this week are a publication date, a list post, an internal navigation link and to add an image.</p>
            
                <p>I also looked at further definition of HTML elements. In week1 I had learnt the difference between block and inline elements. I was also introduced to the further definition of elements in HTML5 using the Lyna tutorials. These had been added to give an HTML page more meaningful syntax and so that the correct tags would be used in the right context. The added categories were Flow, Metadata, Sectioning, Heading, Phrasing, Embedding, and Interactive categories. I looked at some examples where tags from each category should be used.</p>
            
                <h4>What I have achieved in my lab tutorial:</h4>
                
                <ul>
                
                    <li>Make an ordered list post</li>
                    <li>Edited my week1 lab post to include an unordered list</li>
                    <li>Add a date to my weekly posts </li>
                    <li>Add an image to my HTML text </li>
                    <li>I have correctly copyrighted the image </li>
                    <li>I have added an email link in the footer of my HYML text</li>
                                
                </ul>
        
                    <p>Last week I ran my HTML page through the W3c validator. I had one error as can be seen in the image below. I edited my page accordingly and ran it through the validator again and it returned no errors.</p>

                <p> In the week 3 lecture I was introduced to Div tags. Before HTML5 the Div tag was commonly used to mark up sections of an HTML document. However, in HTML5 they have been replaced by more meaningful tags such as header, footer, article and aside. Div tags can still be useful for making up certain sections to be styled in CSS. </p>

              <p> In week 4 I was introduced to the basics of CSS. The basic Syntax of CSS consists of <em class = "s">Selector</em> <em class ="d">{ Declaration }</em>. The declaration parts consists of<br> {<em class = "s"> property</em>:<em class ="d">value </em>}. For example: </p>
                <p><em class = "s">p </em>{<em class ="d"> font-family:Arial </em>}</p>
                    
                    <p class= "p">In this example p is the selector, font family is the property and Arial is the value.</p>
                    
                    <p class="p">
                    I was also introduced to cascade rules and inheritance. The two rules of cascade are last rule – this is where if two selectors are identical with the latter taking precedence -  and specificity – if one Selector is more than the other, that selector will take precedence. Inheritance allows you to give a style to the body selector which will also be applied to most child elements within your HTML. However, this doesn’t apply to all property types but it will apply to font-family and colour. 
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>I was introduced to four types of selectors in CSS:</p>
                            


                                    <dl>
                                        <dt>Type selector :</dt> 
                                        <dd>A selector that will target a specific element i.e. &lt;p&gt; &lt;header&gt; &lt;h1&gt; </dd>
                                        <dt>Class selector :</dt>
                                        <dd>Selector targets elements with the specific class tag.</dd>
                                        <dt>ID selector :</dt> 
                                        <dd>A selector that targets an element with a specific id tag</dd>
                                        <dt>Pseudo-class selector :</dt>
                                        <dd>For certain elements such at the &lt;a&gt; tag for when the user interacts with the content it changes. Selector must have a style for a link, a visited link, a hover link and an active link. It can also have a focus link for when there is keyboard focus.</dd>

                            </dl>             
              
                            
                            
              <h4>What I have achieved in my lab tutorial:</h4>

                        <ul>
                            <li>I saved the normalize.css and my stylesheet.ccs files onto my W: drive. </li>
                            <li>I used type selectors to style different elements and I understood how style precedent works.</li>
                            <li>I used class and ID attribute to style specific elements</li>
                            <li>I used pseudo-class selectors to style my Hyperlinks and I also used a compound selector to style my nav tag with the class attribute menu.</li>
                            <li> I experimented with different style attributes in CSS.</li>

                    <p>In my lab tutorial I experimented with styling the text of my webpage. I have used two Google fonts on my web page. I have used the Lato font for most of my headings. This is a sans-serif font and was used to give the webpage and navigation links a clean and modern look. I used the Google font Cardo for the main content of the webpage. This a more formal serif font and is a nice contrast to the Lato font. I also gave my fonts a fall back font tat will be rendered in browsers that aren't compatible with Google fonts.</p>
            
                    <p>In week 5 I was also introduced to the CSS box model. The CSS box model is a container for each HTML element. In the image below you can see the box model is made up of margin, border, padding and content. The CSS box model is vital in managing the layout of your page.</p>

                <p>In week 6 I have made my website responsive. This is vital in modern web design where a number of devices can be used to browse the internet, with varying viewport widths. I have used the grid style layout on my main learning journal page. In doing my research I decided to design a three column grid for desktops, a two column grid for devices such as tablets and a one column grid for mobiles. A grid layout is key to modern design.</p>
            
                <p>One of the main properties I have been using this week is the display property. This allows me to change block element to be displayed as inline, and vice versa. You can see an example of this in my menu where I have displayed &lt;li&gt; elements as block elements on a wider screen. I have also used it so that the table will not be displayed on a one-column screen.</p>

                <p>In week 7 my aim was to edit my images and to make them responsive. This is very important to make your website fully responsive. I learnt how to edit images and the importance of this in loading times for my webpage.  </p>
            
                <p>To make my images responsive I have used three techniques – clipping an image using the &lt;overflow&gt; property, make an image flexible using the &lt;width&gt; property and wrapping an image within the text using the &lt;float&gt; and &lt;clear&gt; properties.</p>
                
                
                <div class ="fltlt">
               
                <img src="images/btn-code.png"  alt="button code" class="btn-code">
			     
                </div>
                <p>I also animated my buttons to change colour when hovered over. This helps the user to identify that it is a clickable link. I also added a back to top button to be displayed on desktops. I used a Udemy video to see how to do this. I have added an image showing the code I used to achieve this. One property I have added to my buttons is the transition property. This adds a cool effect to my buttons delaying the colour change.</p>

                </div>     
                <p>In week 8 I styled my tutorial page using the flexbox model. By giving an element the declaration – {display:flex} -  the contents within that element will be wrapped in a ‘flex-container’. This makes it easier to layout the page in a particular direction, control the dimensions of the ‘container’ and the spacing between each ‘container’. </p>
                <p>Each step on my tutorial page was wrapped in a container called ‘card’. I styled each ‘card’ the same and I was able to achieve the desired layout on my tutorial page. I believe this gives my tutorial page a clean and modern look.</p>
           
                <p>I also used the position property to credit the photos I have used. To do this I had to give the parent element ‘card’ the position property value of relative and the child element ‘copy’ property value absolute. I could then position the child element using properties bottom and right. </p>

                <p>In week 9 I created a simple HTML form. Forms are an important part of modern web pages. They are useful in getting information from the user and therefore making the webpage a two-way process. I have kept my form simple using simple input of text, text-area and radio buttons. I have also used a submit button. I have added some validation to my form by adding the required element to the name, email and comments sections.</p>
                 
                 <p>My website is now a fully responsive 3 page website. On this website I have tried to show I have begun to understand the workings of HTML and CSS. I have tried to be original and also started thinking about website design.</p>
